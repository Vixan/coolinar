		"2 (3 1/2–4-lb.) chickens, backbones removed, halved through the breastbone",

		"3 heads of garlic, cloves separated, peeled",
		"3 cups vegetable or other neutral oil, divided",

		"Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325°F. Pat chicken halves dry with paper towels and season generously all over with salt.

Reheat shallot oil to 350°F if needed. Working with 1 half at a time and maintaining oil temperature between batches, fry chickens, skin side down, until skin is crisp and deeply browned, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to clean wire racks as you go; season lightly with salt.",

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are very tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, 10–15 minutes, depending on size of potatoes. Drain and return potatoes to the same pot. Gently press down on potatoes to break up slightly. Add 1/3 cup reserved garlic oil, season with salt, and toss to combine.",
		"Transfer potatoes to a small platter. Drizzle with some more garlic oil. Cut chicken halves into pieces and arrange on a large platter. Drizzle chicken with some garlic oil, then sprinkle dill and fried shallots over. Serve with any remaining garlic oil alongside."

One Thanksgiving, my mother and grandmother underestimated their popularity and left them out of the feast, causing a near riot among our extended family. Happily, that mistake was never repeated.",
	"notes": "• Reserved crusts (with some of topping still on them) can be baked at 375°F until lightly browned, about 10 minutes, then cooled. Break up crusts and sprinkle over salads. • Toasts can be prepared and cut 2 weeks ahead and frozen, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container. Thaw before baking. Makes 56 hors d'oeuvres.",

		"1/4 teaspoon black pepper",

		"Trim crusts off bread and reserve for another use (see cooks' note, below), then cut each slice into 4 squares. Bake toasts on baking sheet until beginning to brown on edges, about 20 minutes."

	"title": "Foolproof Grilled Chicken",
	"description": "For the very best results, we brine the chicken before it goes on the grill; sear it over the flames; finish cooking it on the other side of the grill; then toss it in a robust vinaigrette when it's done.",
	"notes": "Special Equipment:\na 22 1/2-inch charcoal kettle grill and a charcoal chimney; or a gas grill. o make a Mediterranean vinaigrette for chicken , whisk together 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 minced large garlic clove, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt, then add 1/3 cup olive oil in a slow stream, whisking.\nChicken can be brined 1 day ahead. Remove from brine, pat dry, and chill, covered.\nIf you aren't able to grill, brined chicken can be roasted, starting with skin sides up, in 2 lightly oiled shallow baking pans in upper and lower thirds of a 500°F oven, switching position of pans and turning chicken over halfway through roasting, until skin is crisp and chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes total. Lime slices can be grilled in a well-seasoned ridged grill pan on top of the stove.",
	"ingredients": [
		"4 quarts cold water",
		"1/4 cup sugar",

		"Remove chicken and pat dry.",
		"Whisk together lime juice, fish sauce, garlic, mint, cilantro, red pepper flakes, and remaining teaspoon salt in a large bowl, then add oil in a stream, whisking until combined.",
		"To cook chicken using a charcoal grill: Open vents on bottom of grill and on lid. Light a large chimney starter of charcoal (80 to 100 briquettes). Leaving about one quarter of grill free of charcoal, bank lit charcoal across rest of grill so that coals are about three times higher on the opposite side.",
		"When charcoal turns grayish white (after 15 to 20 minutes), check fire temperature and grill chicken parts according to instructions in accompanying article. Transfer chicken as cooked to bowl with vinaigrette and turn to coat, then transfer to a serving platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.",

		"To cook chicken using a gas grill: Preheat all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then adjust heat to moderately high.",
		"For drumsticks, thighs, and wings (cooking time is longer than cooking times for charcoal grilling): Sear chicken in 2 batches on lightly oiled grill rack, covered with lid, turning over once, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes total. Turn off 1 burner (middle burner if there are 3) and arrange all seared chicken on rack above shut-off burner.",
		"Cook seared chicken, covered with lid, moving chicken around grill (to avoid flare-ups) and turning over occasionally, until cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken as cooked to bowl with vinaigrette and turn to coat, then transfer to a serving platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.",
		"For breast halves: Sear chicken (in 2 batches if necessary to avoid crowding), starting with skin sides down, on grill, covered with lid, turning over once, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes total.

	"title": "Saffron Breakfast Kheer",
	"description": "Kheer is an Indian rice pudding eaten on high holy days and at feasts. It is a calming mix of gentle spice, milk, and rice, which I find especially good to eat at breakfast time. There is nothing more nourishing to my mind than milk and rice together—easy to eat and cleansing in the best possible sense of the word. I make a double batch of this and reheat it with a little extra milk on the following days; sometimes it's dessert too. Kheer is used in the Ayurvedic tradition to balance the system during the winter; the sweet cinnamon helps digestion, and the warmth of the rice and milk protects against any wintery cold.\n\nI use brown rice here but white rice would be just as delicious. I suggest soaking the rice overnight—it is a two-minute job and will vastly speed up the cooking process. If you don't remember to do it overnight, then soaking it as long as you can will be OK. If saffron is a bridge too far for breakfast, then you can just leave it out; the other spices will hold up.",
	"notes": "",
	"ingredients": [
		"1 cup (150 g) long-grain brown rice",
		"3/4 cup (100 g) cashew nuts",
		"1/3 cup (50 g) blanched almonds",
		"4 1/2 cups (1 L) almond milk (I use unsweetened)",
		"6 cardamom pods",
		"2/3 cup (100 g) raisins (I use golden ones)",
		"1/4 teaspoon ground ginger",
		"A pinch of saffron threads, soaked in 3 1/2 tablespoons (50 ml) boiling water (optional)",
		"1 small cinnamon stick",
		"2 tablespoons golden honey",
		"To serve: The zest of 1 unwaxed lime",
		"A small handful of toasted coconut flakes"
	],
	"directions": [
		"Soak the rice in one bowl and the cashews and almonds in another in cold water for at least 30 minutes but ideally overnight.",
		"In the morning, drain the rice and put it into a saucepan with the milk and 2 cups (500 ml) of cold water and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes at a gentle bubble until the rice has puffed up and the liquid is beginning to thicken.",
		"Meanwhile, drain the nuts and finely chop them—you can do this in a food processor if you like. Bash the cardamom pods in a mortar with a pestle, spice grinder, or mixing bowl with rolling pin and remove the fragrant seeds, then discard the pods and grind the seeds until you have a powder.",
		"After 20 minutes add the nuts, raisins, spices, and honey to the rice and cook for another 15 minutes until thick and creamy, somewhere between rice pudding and porridge. You want to reach the sweet spot where the rice is soft, with very little bite, and the kheer is creamy but not too thick. If it looks like it is thickening too fast, turn the heat down and add a little boiling water from the kettle. Serve spooned into bowls with the lime zest and coconut flakes on top; if you have a sweet tooth, you could add a little extra honey on top."

	"title": "Kimchi and Miso Noodle Soup",
	"description": "I make kimchi purely so that I can make this soup. It is clean-tasting and enlivening, nicely sharp with spice and the mellow, vinegary punch of the kimchi. I don't care much for kimchi on its own (my husband, John, eats it by the jar), but I do think that it is an incredible ingredient to use as a flavorful base for stews, in dressings, and in wraps and sandwiches. The amount of kimchi that you use is quite dependent on how strong it is. My homemade one is quite mellow but store-bought ones can be much more potent, so taste it first and use you tastebuds as a guide, adding more if you need.\n\nI cook with miso a lot, and it happens to be really good for you too. I learned recently that if you heat it too much it loses a lot of its goodness, so now, when I can, I mix it with a little of the liquid i am adding it to, then stir it in at the end like a seasoning and don't cook it for ages.",
	"notes": "I have used gochujang paste here, which is a fermented chile paste from Korea with complex flavors. It's getting easier to find and it does add an extra edge to the soup. If you can't get the paste, dried chile works just fine. Do be careful to check the paste's ingredient list, as some varieties contain ingredients I'd rather not eat!",
	"ingredients": [
		"3 cups (200 g ) Asian mushrooms (enoki, shimeji, shiitake, oyster)",
		"1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce, plus a little extra to season and serve",
		"Juice of 1/2 a lemon",
		"2 tablespoons golden honey or agave nectar",
		"3 cups (250 g) soba noodles (I use 100 percent buckwheat ones)",
		"3 tablespoons sesame oil",
		"Sea salt",
		"6 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped",
		"A small thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and grated",
		"1 teaspoon gochujang paste or red pepper flakes",
		"4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced",
		"3 1/2–5 ounces (100-150 g) cabbage kimchi, drained",
		"3 cups (250 g) purple sprouting broccoli, woody ends removed and cut into thumb-length pieces",
		"3 tablespoons miso paste (I use a brown rice one)",
		"9 ounces (250 g) extra-firm tofu",
		"To serve: Sesame seeds",
		"Squeeze of lemon or lime",
		"Some cilantro or shiso leaves (optional)"
	],
	"directions": [
		"First, put your mushrooms into a bowl with the tamari, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the honey, and put to one side to marinate for at least 15 minutes.",
		"Cook the soba noodles according to packet instructions. Drain and run under cold water, then toss in 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil.",
		"Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large soup pan over medium to high heat. Once the mushrooms have had their marinating time, drain them but keep the marinade Add the mushrooms to the pan in a single layer with a pinch of salt (you can do this in batches if you need to). Cook until the mushrooms are golden where they meet the pan, then toss and keep cooking until the mushrooms are deeply browned all over—this should take 5 minutes or so. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
		"Fill and boil the kettle. Put the empty pan back over medium heat, add the scallions and sauté for a few minutes before adding the ginger and gochujang paste. After another minute or so, add the garlic and the drained kimchi. Sizzle until the garlic is starting to brown around the edges. Add 5 cups (1 1/4 liters) of water from the kettle along with the remaining tablespoon of honey and bring to a boil. Now, add the broccoli and simmer for 1 minute, or just until the broccoli becomes bright green.",
		"Remove the soup from the heat. Place the miso in a small bowl and whisk it with a splash of the broth to thin it out. Stir the thinned miso into the soup. Taste your soup; you really need to get the balance right here. If the broth tastes a bit flat, you might need more salt or miso, or a splash of soy sauce.",
		"Just before serving, cut the tofu into little 3/4-inch (2-cm) pieces—you'll have about 1 cup—and drizzle it with the reserved marinade from the mushrooms.",
		"To serve, divide the noodles among four bowls and ladle over the soup. Top with to tofu, mushrooms, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Finish with more soy if you like, a squeeze of lemon or lime, and the shiso or cilantro leaves if using."

One of our favorite things to make in those days is what is now commonly referred to as Buddha bowls, which are composed of four elements: a grain, vegetables, a protein, and a sauce.
